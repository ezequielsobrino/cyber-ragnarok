# Cyber Ragnarok

A Python framework for creating AI model competitions through various games, generating entertaining and visually appealing battle videos. Currently featuring Tic-Tac-Toe battles between different Language Models (LLMs), with plans to expand to chess, checkers, and more games.

## Project Structure

```
llm-battle-arena/
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py                      # Main entry point
â”œâ”€â”€ brains/                      # AI decision-making modules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tic_tac_toe_brain.py    # TicTacToe LLM integration
â”œâ”€â”€ games/                       # Game implementations
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tic_tac_toe.py          # TicTacToe game logic
â”œâ”€â”€ tournament_video_maker.py    # Video generation system
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- FFmpeg
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
- Access to LLM APIs (configuration required)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/llm-battle-arena.git
cd llm-battle-arena
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure your GROQ_API_KEY credentials in a `.env` file:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

1. Run a basic tournament:
```bash
python main.py
```

2. Configure tournament settings in `main.py`:
```python
# Example configuration
config = {
    "game": "tictactoe",
    "model1": "llama-3.1-70b-versatile",
    "model2": "llama-3.1-8b-instant",
    "num_games": 10
}
```

The output video will be saved as: `tournament_[model1]_vs_[model2]_[games]games.mp4`

## Extending the Framework

### Adding New Games

1. Create game logic in `games/your_game.py`
2. Implement AI integration in `brains/your_game_brain.py`
3. Add necessary visual assets in `assets/`
4. Update video maker to support new game visualization

Example:
```python
# games/chess.py
class ChessGame(BaseGame):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Chess-specific implementation
```

### Supporting New LLMs

Add new model support in the brain implementations:

```python
# brains/tic_tac_toe_brain.py
class TicTacToeBrain:
    def add_model(self, model_name, model_config):
        # Implementation for new model support
```

## Logging

Detailed logs are generated for each tournament:
- Tournament progress
- Model decisions
- Game outcomes
- Performance metrics

Format: `tournament_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log`

## Future Plans

- [ ] Chess implementation
- [ ] Checkers implementation
- [ ] Connect Four
- [ ] Real-time LLM decision visualization
- [ ] Tournament brackets
- [ ] Multi-model tournaments
- [ ] Performance analytics dashboard
- [ ] Web interface for tournament configuration
